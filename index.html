				This site only exists cause I was bored, needed something to do, so here we are, 
				with a full on C++ application to generate Node.js code, and a website.
				This is a hobby project and I personally host and maintain this site.
				I just put some links to stuff on my GitHub here for the most part, I try to make it pretty,
				but Im no web designer, or a designer at all or that matter.
				If your curios and look at the source code of this site, you will notice that its disgusting,
				completely repulsive. I cobbled this together without any knowledge or expierence of HTML,
				CSS, or JvaScript, hell, there isnt even JavaScript at all.
