# Personal-Web-Server
This repo has the code to my personal web server, which can be found running at http://47.147.70.40:3000/ (no longer running), most of the HTML files were created using Google Sites (https://sites.google.com/). Normally you would have it hosted on google server and domain, or pay for a domain. But with Google Takeout, which is intended for account backups, exports, migrations, etc., you can download it. Because of this it is very hard to read, and must have images, and other content of the sort manually added to server.js as requests seperately.
