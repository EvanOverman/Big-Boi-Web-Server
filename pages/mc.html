                <p>The Minecraft server page on the Big Boi server web site. Here is a tutorial on how to set up your device and/or Minecraft accout to connect to the Big Boi server (yes thats the name deal with it). The server has a maximum of 20 players at the time of writing (7/24/2020), the moderator, with OP perms, is _Pratai, or just me.</p>
                <p>First make sure you are on Minecraft version 1.16.1, you can check this by looking nearthe play button on your Minecraft Launcher window, a screenshot are shown, optifine will work perfectly fine and can be found <a href = "http://optifine.net/">here</a>.</p>
                <img src = "/pics/screenshots/Screenshot1.png" alt = "HTML5 Icon" style = "width: 680px;">
                <p>Now press play to open the game, click on the multiplayer button on the home page under the singlplayer button, press "Add Server", then fill it out with the top text box as "Big Boi", and the second as "47.147.70.40:3001", and set "Server Rsource Packs:" to Enabled of Prompt, either will do. You can use any resource pack you like as long as it doesnt differ too much from the defualt, so no strange creative oriented packs that make block look nothing like what they are. Shaders are perefectly fine as well, in fact I use them!</p>
                <img src = "/pics/screenshots/Screenshot6.png" alt = "HTML5 Icon" style = "width: 680px;">
                <p>Thats it! Welcome to the Big Boi Minecraft server! Remeber to be nice and follow common sense rules, YOU CAN BE BANNED.</p>
